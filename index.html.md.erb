<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

This tutorial will help you to deploy a Java web app in minutes.

Hang on for a few more minutes to learn how it all works, so you can make the most out of <%= vars.product_full %>.

The tutorial assumes that you have:

* An <%= vars.product_short %> account
* The latest <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html" target="_blank">Java JDK</a> installed locally
* The latest <a href="https://gradle.org/gradle-download/" target="_blank">Gradle</a> installed locally</li>

Furthermore, you must have a first Cloud Foundry <a href="../concepts/roles.html#orgs" target="_blank">Organization</a> and <a href="../concepts/roles.html#spaces" target="_blank">Space</a> to push your apps to. In case you don't have that yet, please follow the tutorials in the web console before returning here.
