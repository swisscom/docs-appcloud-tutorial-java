The <a href="../service-offerings/index.html" target="_blank">service marketplace</a> has a large number of data stores, from Redis and MongoDB, to MariaDB (fork of MySQL) and RabbitMQ. You can run `cf marketplace` to get an overview. In this step you will add a small Redis datastore to your app.

Create the Redis datastore:

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf create-service redis small my-redis
Creating service instance my-redis in org MyOrg / space MySpace as user@mydomain.com...
OK

Create in progress. Use 'cf services' or 'cf service my-redis' to check operation status.

Attention: The plan `small` of service `redis` is not free.  The instance `my-redis` will incur a cost.  Contact your administrator if you think this is in error.
</pre>

This creates a small Redis datastore for you which you now have to bind to your application. Binding means that the credentials and URL of the service will be written dynamically into the environment variables of the app as `VCAP_SERVICES` and can hence be used directly from there.

Now bind the new service to your existing application:

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf bind-service my-java-app my-redis
Binding service my-redis to app my-java-app in org MyOrg / space MySpace as user@mydomain.com...
OK
TIP: Use 'cf restage my-java-app' to ensure your env variable changes take effect
</pre>

<p class="note">
  <strong>Note</strong>: If you are getting <code>Server error, status code: 409</code>, please try again after a couple of minutes. It takes a while to spin up that Redis datastore for you.
</p>

The credentials and URL of the bound service are available in the environment variables of your app. You can list the environment variables of your app as follows:

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf env my-java-app

System-Provided:
{
 "VCAP_SERVICES": {
  "redis": [
   {
    "credentials": {
     "host": "cbkc81454gjrxxxx.service.consul",
     "password": "RxxkJ75jKTDqxxxx",
     "port": 59282
    },
    "label": "redis",
    "name": "my-redis",
    "plan": "small",
    "provider": null,
    "syslog_drain_url": null,
    "tags": []
   }
  ]
 }
}

...
</pre>

After that you have to restage the application as suggested so that it includes the new credentials in its environment variables:

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf restage my-java-app
Restaging app my-java-app in MyOrg monitor / space MySpace as user@mydomain.com...

...
</pre>

Now you want to consume your new Redis datastore from within your application. In order to do that, you have to adjust the code to store and retrieve data via Redis. But first you have to add the <a href="https://github.com/xetorthio/jedis" target="_blank">Jedis</a> dependency to the `dependencies` section of your `build.gradle` file. Jedis is a Java Redis client that lets your app interact with the Redis server.

```groovy
compile 'redis.clients:jedis:2.6.2'
```

Now adjust the existing `ProductService` class in `src/main/.../ProductService.java` to setup a Redis-based `ProductRepository` implementation.


Add Jedis as a dependency import to the top of the file:

```java
import redis.clients.jedis.Jedis;
```

Adjust the existing `getProductRepository` method in the `ProductService` class as listed below. This method ensures that a Redis-based repository is created when the Redis service binding can be found.

```java
private static ProductRepository getProductRepository() {
        ProcessBuilder processBuilder = new ProcessBuilder();
    String servicesJson = processBuilder.environment().get("VCAP_SERVICES");
    if (servicesJson != null) {
        Map<String,Object> redisCredentials = getRedisCredentials(servicesJson);
        return new RedisProductRepository(redisCredentials);
    } else {
        return new SimpleProductRepository();
    }
}
```

Add the `getRedisCredentials` method below as a new method to the `ProductService` class. This method reads and parses the Redis credentials from the environment variables.

```java
@SuppressWarnings("unchecked")
private static Map<String,Object> getRedisCredentials(String servicesJson) {
  ObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper();
    if (servicesJson != null) {
      try {
        Map<String,Object> services = mapper.readValue(servicesJson, new TypeReference<Map<String,Object>>() { });
        List<Map<String,Object>> redisServices = (List<Map<String, Object>>) services.get("redis");
        for (Map<String,Object> redisService : redisServices) {
          // It is assumed that only one Redis service is bound to this app. Evaluate the name property
          // of the credentials in case multiple Redis services are bound to an app
          return (Map<String, Object>) redisService.get("credentials");
        }
      } catch (Exception exception) {
        throw new RuntimeException("Redis service declaration not found", exception);
      }
   }
   throw new RuntimeException("Redis service declaration not found");
}
```

Now add the new `RedisProductRepository` below as static inner class of `ProductService` class to store and retrieve products via Redis datastore:

```java
public static class RedisProductRepository implements ProductRepository {

  private Jedis jedis;
  private ObjectMapper mapper;

  public RedisProductRepository(Map<String,Object> redisCredentials) {
    jedis = new Jedis((String) redisCredentials.get("host"), (int) redisCredentials.get("port"));
    jedis.auth((String) redisCredentials.get("password"));
    mapper = new ObjectMapper();
  }

  public long add(Product product) {
    product.setId(nextId());
    jedis.rpush("products", mapToJson(product));
    return product.getId();
  }

  public Collection<Product> findAll() {
    return jedis.lrange("products", 0, jedis.llen("products")).stream()
      .map(productJson -> mapToProduct(productJson))
      .collect(Collectors.toList());
  }

  private Long nextId() {
    return jedis.incr("productid");
  }

  private String mapToJson(Product product) {
    try {
      return mapper.writeValueAsString(product);
    } catch (JsonProcessingException e) {
      throw new RuntimeException("Product cannot be serialized as JSON");
    }
  }

  private Product mapToProduct(String productJson) {
    try {
      return mapper.readValue(productJson, Product.class);
    } catch (IOException exception) {
      throw new RuntimeException("Product cannot be deserialized from JSON");
    }
  }

}
```

With this latest code you can still experiment locally, since your app uses the `SimpleProductRepository` instead of the `RedisProductRepository` in case your Redis service binding cannot be found. This allows you to run your app locally as well as in the cloud without having to configure anything differently. However, you must install <a href="http://redis.io/topics/quickstart" target="_blank">Redis</a> on your local machine, if you want to test your app with a local Redis server.

Now compile/build your changes and push them to the cloud:

<pre class="terminal">
$ gradle build
$ cf push my-java-app -p build/libs/cf-sample-app-java-1.0.0.jar
</pre>

You can access other services like MongoDB or MariaDB in a similar matter, simply by binding them to your app and accessing them through the environment variables.
