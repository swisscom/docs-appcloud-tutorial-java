<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

In this step you’ll learn how to propagate a local change to the application through to <%= vars.product_short %>. As a simple change, we'll modify the version returned when accessing the root endpoint `/`.

To do this, change the version in the static INFO variable in the `src/main/java/.../ProductService.class` file'.

Now compile/build and test locally:

<pre class="terminal">
$ gradle build

...

$ java -jar build/libs/cf-sample-app-java-1.0.jar
</pre>

Visiting your application at <a href="http://localhost:4567" target="_blank">http://localhost:4567</a>, you should receive the following response:

```json
{
  "status": "Your Java sample app is up and running !",
  "version": "1.0.01",
  "appMode": null
}
```

Since you already have compiled and built your latest changes, you only need to push your changes to the app cloud. All you need to do is to execute `cf push` again:

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf push my-java-app -p build/libs/cf-sample-app-java-1.0.jar
</pre>

Finally, check that everything is working by visiting your app's URL from your web browser.

<div style="text-align:center;margin:3em;">
  <a href="./environment.html" class="btn btn-primary">I can push local changes</a>
</div>
