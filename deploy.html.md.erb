<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

In this step you will deploy the app to <%= vars.product_full %>.

Before you can push it, you need to compile and build the app using Gradle. To do so, run

<pre class="terminal">
$ gradle build

...

:compileJava
:processResources UP-TO-DATE
:classes
:jar
:assemble
:compileTestJava UP-TO-DATE
:processTestResources UP-TO-DATE
:testClasses UP-TO-DATE
:test UP-TO-DATE
:check UP-TO-DATE
:build

BUILD SUCCESSFUL

Total time: 6.78 secs
</pre>

Gradle will build a Java archive (JAR) file of your app. It is located under `build/libs/cf-sample-app-java-1.0.0.jar`. The Java archive contains all dependencies needed by your app.

Replace "my-random-hostname" with your own hostname and "scapp.io" with an available shared domain (`cf domains` or "Domains" in the portal under your organization) or your own domain. This is the URL your app will be reached at and therefore has to be unique in this Application Cloud.

Now push your app to the cloud by executing the following command:

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf push my-java-app -p build/libs/cf-sample-app-java-1.0.0.jar -n my-random-hostname -d mydomain.com
Creating app my-java-app in org MyOrg / space MySpace as user@mydomain.com...
OK

Creating route my-random-hostname.mydomain.com...
OK

Binding my-random-hostname.mydomain.com to my-java-app...
OK

</pre>

The `-p build/libs/cf-sample-app-java-1.0.0.jar` tells Cloud Foundry where to find the compiled application to push to the cloud.

The application is now deployed. Ensure that the app is running:

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf app my-java-app
Showing health and status for app my-java-app in org MyOrg / space MySpace as user@mydomain.com...
OK

Now visit the app at the URL. You can find the URL in the `urls` property of the statement above.
